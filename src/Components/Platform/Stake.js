                What are Staking Pools? Staking pools are essentially staking
                pools that receive BNB from the Ecosystem, and boost tokens'
                liquidity by buying them on certain contract interactions. The
                purchased tokens are then distributed amongst participants of
                the pool. This concept gives our token its utility. If you want
                to partake in a pool, youâ€™ll have to stake $PTR tokens.
              </p>

              <p>
                We aim to help small-cap tokens and protocols with our pools,
                both with marketing, exposure, and liquidity boosting, since we
                essentially transfer a part of our transaction volume to them.
