              The ICO sale followed by one Private Sale round and a final Public round. After all the tokens get sold for one round, the next round starts. During each phase a certain amount of tokens is sold at a given price. Please refer to our White Paper for the complete details of this process.

              As of now, the listing on Pancakeswap has been confirmed. We are also in discussion with many other exchanges, which we will share at the end of the ICO.

                For instance, if a user subscribed to a period for six
                months, then the tokens are locked for six months and then
                returned to $PTR Smart Contract at the end of the
                subscription
